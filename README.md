# SupplyBench

SupplyBench is a specialised benchmark designed to evaluate question answering systems operating in enterprise settings.
Enterprise environments often involve domain-specific terminology and complex relationships that general-purpose question answering systems may struggle to handle effectively.

SupplyBench consists of two primary components:

* Knowledge graph: A structured representation of the semiconductor industry supply networks, including information about enterprises and their supply relations.
* Query corpus: A collection of question/query pairs about enterprises and supply relations.

Although SupplyBench focuses on the semiconductor industry, we expect that the benchmark's insights also apply to broader enterprise settings.
